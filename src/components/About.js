            I am a lifelong Tennessee resident who enjoys music and teaching. I
            graduated from Tennessee Technological University with a degree in
            History and Spanish, and from there I entered the field of informal
            education and museum learning.

            Like many people, my life and career changed forever with the onset
            of COVID-19. With my work hours reduced, I decided to pick up coding
            in my free time, and immediately fell in love. I enrolled in
            Nashville Software School and began my Web-Development Boot Camp in
            July of 2021.
